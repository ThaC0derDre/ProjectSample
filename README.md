# ProjectSample
This is an example of my freelance work. Ask to see official project and code!

## Summary
This project is a schedule-generating application that saves supervisors <strong>HOURS</strong> of work and stress! <br>
It also helps staff know vital details apart from where they are to be posted on an hourly basis.<br> <br>
Previously, supervisors had to take into consideration over a dozen of conditions to make a daily schedule for their shifts. <br>
This was a headache, a needless IQ puzzle as the schedules are complex and not reusable.  <br>
BUT, what once would take almost an hour for single shift to figure out, now can be done as fast as <strong>A MINUTE! </strong> <br> <br>

### App Abilities: <br>
* Generates a Schedule after considering 15+ conditions
* Saves to Online Database, to make data visiable to anyone with a log-in 
* Highlights the user logged in to know where to be posted for the hour
* Ability to Add, Edit, and Delete Staff/Directories/Schedules/Posts/ and Shifts
* Able to export to PDF as a single spreadsheet, displaying all vital information nicely

### Tech Stack: <br>
* Framework - SwiftUI | Some UIKit & HTML/CSS <br>
* Database - FireBase/FireStore <br>
* Architecture - MVVM



Here, we see a tabview making network calls from the database.
