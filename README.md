## Summary
This project is a Schedule-generating application that saves supervisors <strong>HOURS</strong> of work and stress! <br>
It also helps staff know vital details apart from where they are to be posted on an hourly basis.<br> <br>
Previously, supervisors had to take into consideration over a dozen of conditions to make a daily schedule for their shifts. <br>
This was a headache, a needless IQ puzzle as the Schedules are complex and not reusable.  <br>
BUT, what once would take almost an hour for single shift to figure out, now can be done as fast as <strong>A MINUTE! </strong> <br> <br>

### App Abilities: <br>
* Generates a Schedule after considering 15+ conditions
* Saves to Online Database, to make data visiable to anyone with a log-in 
* Highlights the user logged-in to know where to be posted for the hour
* Ability to Add, Edit, and Delete Staff/Directories/Schedules/Posts/ and Shifts
* Able to export to PDF as a single spreadsheet, displaying all vital information clearly
* Different capabilities for different users (Supervisors have different views and abilities)

### Tech Stack: <br>
* Framework - SwiftUI | Some UIKit & HTML/CSS <br>
* Database - FireBase/FireStore <br>
* Architecture - MVVM


## App Clips
(Left) A tabview making network calls from the database (This loading will only happen upon login). <br>
(Right) Algorithm working to solve multi-varied issues common with creating Schedules.
This particular algorithm is running through 15+ conditions to make the perfect Schedule for the supervisor. <br>
